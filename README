This is the code for the paper titled 'Center Smoothing for Certifiably Robust Vector-Valued Functions'.
The main code for Center Smoothing procedure is available in the file center_smoothing.py.
The model architectures are available in model.py.

Download and place the CelebA dataset in a directory with the name 'data'.

To train models run:

python train_face_rec.py [path to save trained model] --sigma [value of sigma]
python train_dim_red.py [path to save trained model] [dataset] --latent_dim [number of latent dimensions] --sigma [value of sigma]
python train_reconstructor.py [path to save trained model] [dataset] [path to measurement matrix] --sigma [value of sigma]

To generate certificates run:

python test_face_rec.py [path to trained model] [path to save certificates] --eps_in [value of epsilon in] --sigma [value of sigma]
python test_dim_red.py [path to trained model] [path to save certificates] [dataset] --eps_in [value of epsilon in] --sigma [value of sigma] --latent_dim [number of latent dimensions]
python test_reconstructor.py [path to trained model] [path to save certificates] [dataset] [path to measurement matrix] --eps_in [value of epsilon in] --sigma [value of sigma]

To compute median certificate run:

python get_median_cert.py [path to certificate file]
